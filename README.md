This is a course from `SUSTech` `CS205`, `C & C++ Program Design`.

I only get `B` in this course. To tell the truth, Prof. Yu was not generous.

It was really difficult to do those reports for me because I had never do something alike before. But if you could try your best, then I strongly recommend this course because it would be one of the best optional courses in `SUSTech`.

    | Project 1,  A Simple Calculator                 | 77    | Good. But the source code can still be improved.             |
    | Project 2,  Matrix Multiplication               | 86    | Good.                                                        |

    | Project 4,  A Class to Describe a Matrix        | 89    | roi方案分析的很好，但使用parent不是一个好的roi方案，如果parent还有parent呢？<br />for循环内部高频调用operator()函数，对性能来说是一场灾难。 |
