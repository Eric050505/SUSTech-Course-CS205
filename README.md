This is a course from SUSTech CS205, C & C++ Program Design.

I only get B in this course. It was really difficult to do those reports. But if you could try your best, then I think it would be a good optional course.

    | Project 1,  A Simple Calculator                 | 77    | Good. But the source code can still be improved.             |
    | Project 2,  Matrix Multiplication               | 86    | Good.                                                        |
    | Project 3,  Improved Matrix Multiplication in C | 88    | -                                                            |
    | Project 4,  A Class to Describe a Matrix        | 89    | roi方案分析的很好，但使用parent不是一个好的roi方案，如果parent还有parent呢？<br />for循环内部高频调用operator()函数，对性能来说是一场灾难。 |
